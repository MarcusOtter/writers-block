Hello Adam!

I am one of Alexander Eriksson's students who, if you recall, payed you and campus Gotland a visit last June during your game conference. I've decided I want to pursue game programming, and that I want to do it down at Gotland.

It was my understanding that in order to get into the programming course, one needed to do quite a lot of maths. As such, whenever I've been given the choice of adding a course to my schedule, I've added maths. I'm now doing maths 3B, where only maths 1B was obligatory.

It was only recently that I read the specific requirements for your game design & programming course, which entailed that I needed to have studied at least maths 3C, which typically isn't taught outside the context of science or engineering courses or IB. Because my course, game design, is a subcourse of the arts, I am not even given the option of studying any of maths C at all (unless I find a way of doing it on my own, alongside everything else that needs to be done in year 3 of sixth form).

That said, I am reaching out to you to ask what other potential ways of proving myself are available to me when applying. I know that one is given the opportunity of submitting a portfolio when applying for game design and graphics. Can one submit a portfolio when applying for programming?

Hope I'm asking the right person. Thought I'd e-mail you first regarding this matter, as you'd said we should reach out to you if we had any questions. I'd be happy to get a reply on here, or on the phone (070-9090909) if you don't bother with the formalities of writing an e-mail.

Cheers! : )
