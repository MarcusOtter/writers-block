I am the world's greatest typist, writer, author, thinker and creator. I am able to effortlessly throw together some of the greatest works known to man without even putting the slightest bit of thought into them. I am truly a modern day renaissance man. Humble, too.
    The question isn't if I am capable of writing works worthy of the highest and most prestigious awards; the only question is if I bother clicking the buttons on my keyboard enough times to give life to these pieces.

No genius comes without its hint of insanity. I tend to not even know what I'm creating whilst creating it. Weird how that works.
